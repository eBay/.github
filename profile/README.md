# eBay Open Source

eBay is a global commerce leader which empowers people and creates economic
opportunity. We publish open source code to share technical artifacts with the
broader community and publish [a tech blog](https://innovation.ebayinc.com/tech/) to share
our experiences.

If you're hoping to build integrations with eBay using our open source toolkit,
please visit [the eBay Developers Program](https://developer.ebay.com/).

In order to provide an inclusive environment, we adhere to a [code of
conduct](https://github.com/eBay/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
